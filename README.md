# MacMove


Things to note:

*The shortname has to be the same on both devices. I used the $USER command to accomplish this.

*It will open the applications first to create folder structures on the computer it’s transferring to first.

*In order for the Google Drive transfer to work, you need to open Google Drive on the new computer, sign in, quit when it begins to sync. This will allow you to then manually move over the ~/Google Drive folder so that the Google Drive app doesn’t need to download the entire folder again. You will need to locate the ~/Google Drive folder when you re-open the Google Drive app for the first time.

---------------------------------------

Items that get transferd:

*dock plist

*Firefox folder with bookmarks

*Safari bookmarks plist

*Google Chrome folder with bookmarks
Google Drive folder (~/Application Support/Google/Drive/ not the user ~/Google Drive folder which needs to be done manually later)
